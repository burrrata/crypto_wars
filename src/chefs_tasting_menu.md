# Hello everyone! 

Thank you for exploring our tasting menu! 
Our goal is to wet your appetite and give you a taste of some of the commonly used cryptography in cryptoeconomic protocols. 
You'll come away with an understanding of the main ingredients involved in
cryptoeconomic blockchain protocols as well as an appreciate for best practices and why they matter. 
While this course won't make you a master chef, we'll arm you with the resources to get started. 
If you're hungry and want to learn more, at the end of each course we provide links to more resources 
and... (drumroll) a [cookbook](https://burrrata.github.io/the_cryptoeconomics_cookbook/) is in the works :)

# Chef's Tasting Menu

### part 1: A New Club
Alice and Bob build a treehouse. Like anyone with a treehouse they start a secret club. Eve wants to unmask their passphrase though so they create an elaborate code to keep it secret.

<hr>

### part 2: Eve Strikes Back
Eve uses cryptanalysis to unscramble the messages and decrypt Alice and Bob's codes and passphrase. Everyone knows and the club is in shambles! What to do?!

<hr>

### part 3: Return of the Code
Thrwarted by Eve, Alice and Bob hunker down in the playground and come up with new ideas, and find new hope. Will they finally be able to create thier club? Will this become even more useful than they thought?! We will find out... (content addressing, avalanche functions, etc...)

TODO: 
- How does the tasting menu / chef theme work with the star wars themes? Does the inconsistency even matter? 
- theme: menu with font in the style of the French Laundry
