## A New Club
Alice and Bob build a treehouse. Like anyone with a treehouse they start a secret club. Eve wants to unmask their passphrase though so they create an elaborate code to keep it secret.

<br>

## Eve Strikes Back
Eve uses cryptanalysis to unscramble the messages and decrypt Alice and Bob's codes and passphrase. Everyone knows and the club is in shambles! What to do?!

<br>

## Return of the Code
Thrwarted by Eve, Alice and Bob hunker down in the playground and come up with new ideas, and find new hope. Will they finally be able to create thier club? Will this become even more useful than they thought?! We will find out... (content addressing, avalanche functions, etc...)
- it would be cool to actually have a gif/video of an avalanche to emphasize that while you know **something** happened, you can't which piece of snow on the ground came from which place on the mountain because it's all jumbled up (and would be uniquely for every new avalanche)
