# Hello everyone! 
Welcome to cryptoeconomics.studyâ€™s three part tasting menu on cryptography!

Our goal is to give you a taste of how cryptoeconomic protocols work. 
You'll come away with an understanding of the main ingredients involved in
cryptoeconomic blockchain protocols as well as an appreciate for best practices. 
While this course won't make you a master chef, we'll arm you with the resources to get started. 
If you're hungry and want to learn more, at the end of each course we provide links to more resources 
and... (drumroll) a [cookbook](https://burrrata.github.io/the_cryptoeconomics_cookbook/) is in the works :)
