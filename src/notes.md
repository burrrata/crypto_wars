## Decentralized vs Permissioned Blockchains

This is a huge concept that needs to be clearly and explicitly explained. Maybe on Cryptoeconomics.Study?

"we must make sure it’s clear for everyone that for a blockchain to bring about all its benefits, blocks, hashes and consensus mechanisms aren’t enough. What’s necessary (on top of the above) is an underlying peer-to-peer network — sufficiently large and decentralised."
