# Notes
- ideas and things that may or may not fit in with this series/storyline

## Decentralized vs Permissioned Blockchains

This is a huge concept that needs to be clearly and explicitly explained. Maybe on Cryptoeconomics.Study?

"we must make sure it’s clear for everyone that for a blockchain to bring about all its benefits, blocks, hashes and consensus mechanisms aren’t enough. What’s necessary (on top of the above) is an underlying peer-to-peer network — sufficiently large and decentralised."

## UI

Changed default theme to 'ayu' in book.js

If that's no good, you can recover the default book.js by creating a new directory and running ```mdbook init --theme```
