<p>Back in the day, for most of human history, if someone wanted to communicate securely they had to either be in the same place at the same time, or use a shared secret code to encrypt and decrypt messages. This was problematic because in order to agree on and share a secret code you had first meet in person, and then if you changed your mind or someone broke your code you'd have to meet up again to agree to a new scheme. Not practical in a 24/7 globally connected digital world. Fortunately for us, a few guys named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Merkle">Merkle</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitfield_Diffie">Diffie</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Hellman">Hellman</a> came up with some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">pretty cool ideas</a> on how to securely share private data over public networks.</p>

<p>Alice and Bob built a treeshouse. Like anyone with a treehouse, they started a secret club. Like every secret club, there needs to be a secret way to prove that you're part of the secret club. Normally there would just be a cool passphrase or knock that you would yell to have the rope thrown down, but... this means that anyone nearby could learn their secret code! This wouldn't be that big of a deal, but there's this chick named Eve who believes that the world should have no secrets, and especially no secret clubs. Why? We'll never know, but she's always watching... and whenever she learns anything she posts it on the school bulletin board for everyone to know. Now Timmy has a daily panic attack when people put bugs in his desk and Sarah has to wear ear plugs incase anyone utters a palindrome, and they often do. Needless to say, if everyone knew the clubs secret code it would be a disaster ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</p>
<a class="header" href="#what-to-do" id="what-to-do"><h3>What to do?</h3></a>
<p>Alice and Bob come up with a plan... First they thought about using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">secret colors</a> because that seems to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmM9HA2MQGI">what everyone else is doing</a>, but when they tried it everything just turned brown. This meant anyone could just mix all the colors together to produce brown without actually knowing Alice and Bob's secret colors! Not cool, and besides, who wants to live in a world where everything's brown? Requiring a practical solution, Alice and Bob press on, and on one dismal afternoon, while staring at the clock, waiting, for school, to be over... they get an idea! A big one! What if instead of using colors, they used numbers, but instead of using any random numbers, they used numbers that wrap around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjrfm_oRO0w">like a clock does</a>?</p>

<p><code>TODO: explain [primitive root modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_root_modulo_n) stuff linking 5 to 23</code></p>
<p>First, the club gets a number. After much consideration Alice and Bob decide that the number shall be 5, and 5 shall be the number. They tell everyone. 5 club is lit af. Everyone wants in, esp Eve...</p>
<p>Then, the club gets a secret passphrase. At first only Alice and Bob know it, but as well all know, 5 club is lit af so soon more people join. They all know the passphrase, but they can't say it out loud because Eve could be anywhere anytime, always watching... This is truly annoying.</p>
<p>To get around this unfortunate dilema, Alice and Bob create a number system where, like clocks, the numbers wrap around if you go past the maximum number. In this case we're using a 24hrs clock that wraps around after 23.</p>
<p>Also, everyone who's part of the club has a secret number. In fact, the club itself even has a secret number. These numbers are so secret that no one knows what they are or might be. They are truly random and unknown. They could be anything...</p>
<p>Everyone, including the club, also has a public number. These are kind of like an address and everyone knows what these are. How do we create these public numbers in a way that connects them to the private numbers? Well it's easy, just multiply the club's number by it's self (exponentiation) as many times as a person's secret number, but wrap around everytime they go past 23 (like on a clock). For example: if Jim's secret number is 4, then Jim would multiple the club's public number 4 times (5 * 5 * 5 * 5), but would wrap around everytime the value was higher than 23. The symbol for this is %, and the mathematical term is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation">modulo operation</a>.</p>

<p>Now Jim has a public number (4), but no one knows what number was multiplied around the clock to get there. Could be 5**4, could be 5**26, could be 5**136, or many others...</p>

<p>Good question. The way to check that Jim is part of the club is to do a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jim multiplies the club's public number times itself as many times as his secret number</li>
<li>Whoever is in the club multiplies Jim's public number times itself as many times as the club secret number</li>
<li>They then write each number down on a piece paper, fold the papers into airplanes, and throw them at each other. Now both Jim and the people in the club have a shared secret that no one else knows that they can use to scramble and unscramble the secret passphrase!</li>
<li>Jim scrambles every letter in the passphrase forward by the shared secret number.</li>
<li>Jim then proceeds to yell that new series of letters out loud.</li>
<li>Whoever is in the club writes down those letters, then shifts them backwards by the amount of the shared secret number.</li>
<li>If it reveals the passphrase, Jim is in!</li>
<li>Also, even though Eve is creeping in the bushes nearby, everyone who yells a scrambled passphrase to get in yells a different one because it's scrambled based on their unique numbers!</li>
<li>Eve tries again and again to yell random passphrases but it doesn't work. Horray!</li>

<p>Now you're probably wondering: &quot;Isn't that a bit convoluted? I mean they could just have a list of people's names and then look out the window and see if that person is the person on the list!&quot; They <strong>could</strong>, but what about on Halloween when everyone's wearing costumes, or at night when it's dark, or during they day when they're bored? These are the questions that keep me up at night, and apparently Alice and Bob feel the same way. Now they can have their secret club with secret numbers and all Eve knows is that whenever she tries to guess the passphrase by saying random numbers it doesn't work. Yay!</p>

<ul>
<li>Explain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_root_modulo_n">primitive root modulo</a> stuff linking 5 to 23</li>
<li>Incorporate the Secrecy Chart explanation from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">wikipedia article</a> (and the actual chart) into the storyline to further clarify why this theoretically works as well as to create a more analytical reference point when we want to break and then strengthen/extend it with stronger primes.</li>
<li>Once the story line is solidified and all the concepts are in place, THEN clean up the spaghetti code and add comments that bridge the storyline (english) to the working example (code).</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#ux-todos" id="ux-todos"><h2>UX TODOS</h2></a>
<ul>
<li>It would be great to incorporate the concept of public keys as addresses that people can send mail to, but only the person who owns the address (controls the key) can open the mailbox. (good because addresses for houses/mailbox and keys to access said houses/mailboxes are concepts people already understand.)</li>
<li>Would it be good to recreate the &quot;<a href="https://github.com/cryptoeconomics-study/website/blob/master/book/chapter-01.md#the-math-y-explanation">Math-y Explanation</a>&quot; using arbitrary variables to get the general concept down, and then apply it to Jim, and then apply that to A&amp;B?</li>
<li>Is it confusing that Jim's public number is the same as his private number, even though the modulo stuff is explained and demonstrated?</li>
<li>Make sure that there are no trailing references to the Club Public Number when it should be the Club Base Number which is 5.</li>
<li>To minimize vocabulary juggling and manitain relevance in the context of public private key crypto, search and replace:
<ul>
<li>number =&gt; key</li>
<li>secret =&gt; private</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Would it be easier for people to read/engage with the code if we used strings and chars instead of Vecs? (the passphrases would be easier to work with and it would work better for APIs or CLI applications, but the functions would be convoluted af) (a little verbose, but maybe we could use strings and make the functions convert the strings to Vecs and back again within the function?)</li>

<a class="header" href="#overall-theme--main-takeaway" id="overall-theme--main-takeaway"><h2>Overall Theme / Main Takeaway</h2></a>
<ul>
<li>don't roll your own crypto like Alice and Bob did 👍</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<a class="header" href="#concepts-to-cover" id="concepts-to-cover"><h2>Concepts To Cover</h2></a>
<ul>
<li>explain how it is NOT ideal for multiple private keys to correlate to the same public key (collision!) and show ways that Eve can exploit this! Then lead into how Alice and Bob might remedy that situation with larger primes and a better scrambling funciton.</li>
<li>man in the middle attacks =&gt; spoofing, rerouting, or crypanalysis of scrambled messages</li>
<li>rate limiting to prevent online brute force attacks (does not prevent captured messages via MIM attacks and offline hash cracking via rainbow tables or hashcat)</li>
<li>randomness (Alice and Bob use the same keys every time, so Eve can perform cryptanalysis)</li>
<li>things that are hard to guess for humans vs computers (demo a brute force cracking attack) (stretch goal: a social engineered cracking attack based on Alice and Bob's favorite things)</li>
<li>social engineering via publicly available security questions</li>
<li>Hash Collisions: yet another way Eve can pretend to be someone else and mess with A&amp;B's club</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#concepts-to-hint-at" id="concepts-to-hint-at"><h2>Concepts To Hint At</h2></a>
<ul>
<li>(2/3) Content Addressing: digital files be easily tampered with... so how do we sign things digitally while preserving all the characteristics that make a signature a signature? Content addressing! (not sure if this is relevant yet as Alice and Bob aren't using software yet, but maybe hint at it here and then have A&amp;B impliment it in part3?) (would it be accurate/relevant to also say that using a compiled language like Rust allows for you to verify the authenticity/security of code before running it, whereas JS and Python run in real time and thus can call weird things on the fly?)</li>
<li>(intro/all) Goals Of Cryptography:
<ul>
<li>Integrity: The message I send will arrive at its intended destination intact and unchanged.</li>
<li>Authenticity: I can ascertain that the sender and the recipient of the message are the correct ones.</li>
<li>Non-repudiation: An event that has taken place cannot be denied.</li>
<li>Confidentiality: That which is intended to be private will be kept private.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(2/3) Trapdoors: Functions that are easy to compute but difficult to invert are called one way functions. A subset of one way functions are trapdoor functions - the only difference being that trapdoor functions can be inverted as long as you have some special secret k. (What if we had Eve pretend to help A&amp;B, but really she was offering them tricky software that her friend Mal created that has a trapdoor in it?)</li>
<li>(3) Cryptographic hash function:
<ul>
<li>Collision resistant: Given two inputs a and b, it is computationally expensive to find H(a) = H(b)</li>
<li>Preimage resistant: Given only the output of H(a), it is computationally infeasible to find a. Brute forcing (guessing every possible input) should be the only way to find it, which is expensive</li>
<li>Second-preimage resistant: Given a, one cannot find b such that H(a) = H(b).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(3) Hashes As Commitments: how can this example be incorporated into the story?
<ul>
<li>A writer who wants to copyright their manuscript on a certain date can publish a hash of their manuscript to the blockchain, where it gets timestamped. Should there be any dispute over the manuscript in the future, it would be very easy to verify whether the manuscript was hashed and signed on a certain day. It is also important to note that simply changing one letter in the manuscript, or even one bit in the input, should change a large portion of the bits in the output. Hash functions are mainly used for securing the integrity of information and thus also can act as unique identifiers. Since hash functions are deterministic, they are able to prove that certain pieces of information have not been tampered with. If information is tampered with, it will produce a different hash to the original version.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(2/3) Lamport Signatures: further emphasizes the concept of public keys as addresses and private keys as access, but furthers it by using it to prove things more like an account can post stuff on apps and social networks.
<ul>
<li>For Person A to sign a document, a hash value is produced from that document using a hash function. Person A uses the encryption key, which is kept hidden, to encrypt the hash value of the document to produce a cipher-text: E(H). For Digital Signing Algorithms (DSA), the encryption key is the private key that is kept a secret and the decryption key is the public key that is published into the open. Person A publishes the document and along with the E(H). Anyone can verify that person A has signed the document by hashing the document and then using Person A’s trusted and published decryption key to decrypt the cipher-text E(H) to produce the same hash of the document. If the document hashes match, then the signature is valid.</li>
<li>It would be really great to create a code example for this because as is it's a solid example, but a little handwavey on the details. &quot;You can think of the decryption of the right hash as the signature itself. The successful decryption is proof it is never exposed but rather the key used for encryption. The uniquely transformed cipher-text is proof of signature.&quot; &lt;= like wtf does that even mean? An example would clarify it immensely :)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Hashes allow us to fingerprint some information with a short name. Anyone can take the hash of some file and save it. You can then use this hash to prove to others that you (a) have seen the file before (b) no one has tampered with the file.</li>
<li>a secure hash has several properties: avalanche effect, preimage resistance, etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the Bitcoin whitepaper has a certain hash. A while ago the Bitcoin Core foundation wanted to change the official URL of the whitepaper. They wanted it to point to an “improved” version of this whitepaper that Satoshi wrote. Since they control the bitcoin.org URL they can do this. A long time ago someone with foresight saved the hash of this whitepaper in the Blockchain. This means it’s very easy to see if someone well-intentional changes the original file.ered with the file.</p>

<a class="header" href="#encryption" id="encryption"><h3>Encryption:</h3></a>
<p>The process of turning a clear-text message (often called Plaintext) into a data stream which looks like a meaningless and random sequence of bits (called ciphertext). The process of turning ciphertext back into plaintext is called decryption.</p>
<a class="header" href="#symmetric-key-encryption" id="symmetric-key-encryption"><h3>Symmetric Key Encryption:</h3></a>
<p>Use the same key for encryption and decryption. These algorithms require that both the sender and receiver agree on a key before they can exchange messages securely.</p>
<a class="header" href="#public-key-algorithms-also-known-as-asymmetric-algorithms" id="public-key-algorithms-also-known-as-asymmetric-algorithms"><h3>Public-key algorithms (also known as asymmetric algorithms):</h3></a>
<p>Use two different keys (a key pair) for encryption and decryption. The keys in a key pair are mathematically related, but it is computationally infeasible to deduce one key from the other. These algorithms are called “public-key” because the encryption key can be made public. Anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message, but only the owner of the corresponding private key can decrypt it.</p>
<a class="header" href="#public-key" id="public-key"><h3>Public Key:</h3></a>
<p>these can be public facing and are often like an address that anyone can send information to.</p>
<a class="header" href="#private-key" id="private-key"><h3>Private Key:</h3></a>
<p>every public address has a unique private key. Whoever controls the private key controls the address. While anyone can send data to the public key, only the private key can autorize data to be sent out from the address. This means that you can prove to others that you wrote a certain message. For example, that you authorized a transaction, voted, or posted some content at a certain time before anyone else.</p>
<a class="header" href="#commitment-scheme" id="commitment-scheme"><h3>Commitment Scheme</h3></a>
<p>a cryptographic primitive that allows one to commit to a chosen value (or chosen statement) while keeping it hidden to others, with the ability to reveal the committed value later.[1] Commitment schemes are designed so that a party cannot change the value or statement after they have committed to it: that is, commitment schemes are binding. Commitment schemes have important applications in a number of cryptographic protocolsincluding secure coin flipping, zero-knowledge proofs, and secure computation.</p>
<p>A way to visualize a commitment scheme is to think of a sender as putting a message in a locked box, and giving the box to a receiver. The message in the box is hidden from the receiver, who cannot open the lock themselves. Since the receiver has the box, the message inside cannot be changed—merely revealed if the sender chooses to give them the key at some later time.</p>
<p>Interactions in a commitment scheme take place in two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>the commit phase during which a value is chosen and specified</li>
<li>the reveal phase during which the value is revealed and checked</li>
</ul>

<p>Blockchain: a merklized linked list of blocks where each new block commits a group of transactions/data to the previous one via a hash function, forming a chain of blocks. In order to commit a group of transactions/data, you need to solve a very very complicated puzzle. If one were to try to retroactively change the data in a previous block, you would need quite a bit of compute power to solve all the puzzles between the current block and the block being changed. Considering that all the computers mining blocks (solving puzzles and committing information) on the bitcoin blockchain vastly surpass the compute power of all the world's supercomputers combined... this seems unlikely. Not impossible, but unlikely.</p>

<li>example: if I lock up $X staking ETH, the rate of return/interest has to be MORE than I could get from other investments, including those outside of the crypto world like bonds. This is important otherwise the only participation will be due to altruism, which is a weak strategy.</li>
